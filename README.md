# CAN-bus-network-node

The main intent of this project was to develop a universal PCB which could be incorporated into any vehicle's instrumentation network inorder to provide CAN bus interface capability. The PCBSs will serve as nodes on the CAN bus. Each node will offer the following features :-
* An ESP32 microcontroller
* Precision ADC with matched front end having 8 analog inputs
* Wheel speed sensor interface
* Isolated CAN bus interface
* Isolated UART interface for debugging and diagnostic
